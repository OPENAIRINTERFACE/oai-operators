kubernetesType: Vanilla  #Vanilla for community kubernetes distribution else Openshift for Openshift

## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images
## To know more about them follow this tutorial https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/tree/master/openshift

#service type is fixed to clusterIP, it is only support for non multus interface (eth0)

# These helm-charts can be used for two purpose
# 1. RFSimulated oai-gNB: Only requires 1 interface for N2 and N3. You can use Kubernetes default interface eth0
# 2. Physical gNB with Ethernet based USRP or RRU: You need to use ruInterface to connect with RU. Make sure that the ip-address you choose can reach to RU. 
#                                                 Using a dedicated interface for N2 or N3 is optional you can still use eth0. 
# 3. Another thing you can chose to use same virtual interface for N2/N3 its optional to have two different

## NOTE: To use these charts with USRP B210 you need to modify and mount usb from the host. 
## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment

## If you want to change more configuration parameters then you should mount the config file  
# in templates/configmap.yaml
# Example config files --> https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/-/tree/develop/targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF 
config:
  mountConfig: false          #If config file is mounted then please edit mount.conf in configmap.yaml properly 
  rfSimulator: "server"       #If you are not using in RFsimulator mode then you can leave this empty
  timeZone: "Europe/Paris"
  ## -E is to apply three-quarter of sampling frequency, 23.04 Msps to reduce the data rate on USB/PCIe transfers (only valid for 20 MHz)
  ## The configuration file in config-map does not require -E

## NF is the network function and tcpdump is the tcpdump container.
